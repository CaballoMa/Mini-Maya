# Mini-Maya

In this project, I built a mirco Maya from scratch with C++ and OpenGL in QT Creator. The final version includes basic functions including:

* Mesh manipulation
* Catmull-Clark subdivision
* Skeleton and skinning
* Object loading

A final user interface based on QT GUI is shown below. 

## Result
